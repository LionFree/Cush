// Setting ComVisible to false makes the types in this assembly not visible 
// to COM components.  If you need to access a type in this assembly from 
// COM, set the ComVisible attribute to true on that type.

// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
//
//      Major Version
//      Minor Version 
//      Build Number
//      Revision
//
// You can specify all the values or you can default the Build and Revision Numbers 
// by using the '*' as shown below:
// [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.*")]
[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.0.0")]
[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.0.0")]

// In many cases, using compiled Expression trees instead of 'hard coded' code results 
// in a performance regression, with the profiler indicating that the additional time 
// is spent in JIT_MethodAccessCheck. 
// It is possible to make runtime-generated code run twice as fast as 'hard coded' code 
// (half the time to complete). By decorating the assembly with the following attributes, 
// the whole security check can be eliminated:
//[assembly: AllowPartiallyTrustedCallers]
//[assembly: SecurityTransparent]
//[assembly: SecurityRules(SecurityRuleSet.Level2, SkipVerificationInFullTrust = true)]
