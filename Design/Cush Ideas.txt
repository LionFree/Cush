CUSH IDEAS - Implement Top Items First
(** implement when needed / problem domain is better understood)
(?? consider)
==========================================================================================

Cush.Testing
	(done) Get a random value of any numeric type T
	(done) Method timing code.
	** Verify a data object doesn't throw an exception when being hammered by multiple threads
		** Get Framework Version (Only really helps if compiled on the latest version of the Framework)
		** Get Messagebox Content
		** Provide strongly typed access to a compile-time string representing the name of a variable, field, property, method, event, enum value, or type. 
		** Collection equality assertions : Assert.AreEqual(ExpectedCollection, ActualCollection)
		Assert.AreEqual(ExpectedCollection, ActualCollection)

Cush.Common
	Base Classes
		(done) Disposable, 
		(done) EquatableDisposable, 
		(done) PropertyChangedBase, 
		(done) BoundedList<T>,
	Common Interfaces
		(done) ILogger (to pass around to ResourceSystem)
	Exceptions
		Exception Handler
		Exception Thrower
	Exceptions (Exception handler)  
	** Async (AsyncWorker)
	** Bootstrapping (CompositionRoot) 
		- OR - use this as a pattern, make the static GetInstance class the Composition Root
	?? DependencyInjection
		A generic factory class
		GetInstance<IFactoryCreateable>(params object[] args);  SLOW???  
		(see http://geekswithblogs.net/mrsteve/archive/2012/02/19/a-fast-c-sharp-extension-method-using-expression-trees-create-instance-from-type-again.aspx)

Cush.ResourceSystem - Wrapped Resource- or File-System
	Add ILogger to constructors
	IO (serialization)
	
Cush.CommandLine
	Parser
	ConsoleProxy
	
Cush.Windows
	Single Instance

Cush.Windows.Services
	Cush.Services (Windows Service Framework, GenericHost)
	
Cush.Composition (MEF)
	Resources
	?? AutoConfig?

Cush.WPF (WPF specific)
	In-app Logging dialog
	Exception dialog
	Controls
	?? MVVM (WPF-specific)

Cush.Windows.Forms
	
Cush.Communication
	Cush.REST
	Cush.Email


	
MVVM Ideas
==========================================================================================

Cush.MVVM	(MVVM - AVOID using WPF-specific methods here, so that WinForms folks can use it too)
	View only knows about the shape of the ViewModel; binds to properties on VM
	ViewModel only knows about the shape of the Model; binds to properties on Model
	Model just holds and manipulates its own data

	Must support View-First and ViewModel-First

	ViewModel (the ViewModel should ideally be kept ignorant of the view)
		?? ViewModel.RequestDialog<TDialog>(params object[] args)
		?? 	Extension for requesting a view on the fly (i.e., show this dialog, please)
		?? 	This should really be done on the view, responding to some bound property

	View
		?? TViewModel ViewModel {get{return (TViewModel)DataContext;}} where TViewModel:ViewModel

	RelayCommand - Careful not to use WPF-specific assemblies
	EventToCommand behavior - Careful not to use WPF-specific assemblies




NOTES
==========================================================================================

	Library classes should be defined with Constructor Injection throughout.
		Simple DI Facade
		Property Injection vs Constructor Injection

	Use abstract factory when 
	DI Friendly Library: 	http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/05/19/di-friendly-library/
	DI Friendly Framework:	http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/05/19/di-friendly-framework/

	Domain model 
		Contains objects that the business expects,  i.e., shopping cart, NOT Giraffe
		The "Service Layer" part of the model can be called "Business Logic Layer" (Service is a weasel word.)


MAYBE
==========================================================================================
	Cush.Eventing ?? WeakEvents?
	Cush.AutoConfig ??
	Generic Rest Mediator??  Can this happen? Easily? Worth it?

"Running PerfMonitor on my computer reports that 43% of the total run time is spent in GC. 
If you rewrite your code to use fewer temporary objects, you should see the desired 4x speedup."
	
	Look @ plugins for Fody
		Fody.AsyncErrorHandler (Integrates error handling into async and TPL code.)
		AutoDependencyProperty (Generates WPF DependencyProperty boilerplate from automatic C# properties.)
		Caseless (Change string comparisons to be case insensitive.)
		Commander (Injects ICommand properties and implementations for use in MVVM applications.)

		EmptyStringGuard (Adds empty string argument checks to an assembly.)
		EnableFaking (Allows faking your types without writing interfaces for testing purposes only.)
		Equals (Generate Equals, GetHashCode and operators methods from properties.)
		MethodTimer (Injects method timing code.)
		ReactiveUI (Generates ReactiveUI RaisePropertyChange notifications for properties and ObservableAsPropertyHelper properties.)


	dw = DWORD = 32bit unsigned integer (range: 0 through 4,294,967,295 decimal)
				 Used extensively by Windows 
				 Currently DWORD = UInt32 (not CLS compliant)
				 	Use int and do the conversion  
				 		int x;
				 		uint y = unchecked((uint) x);
				 	OR make the method internal
